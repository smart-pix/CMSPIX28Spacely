// The iospec defines which pins on the NI (typically 0~31) are used for which ASIC signals.


// All I/O definitions need to be inside a "HARDWARE XYZ BEGIN ... END" block to tell which NI hardware we're talking about.


// PXI1Slot4 = The NI slot we are using.
// NI6583 = The type of IO card attached to the FPGA in this slot.
// se_io = single-ended I/O (the NI6583 also supports lvds)
